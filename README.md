# Google Analytics Capstone Project
This is my Project for my portfolio after finishing all the courses from the program. I have chosen the Bike city project and to use the R Studio/R desktop version to complete the case following the steps of cleaning, analyzing, and creating visualizations for the data.

## Bike case scenario
I’m a junior Data Analyst in a Cyclistic company that focuses on a system to share different types of bikes to users through an application. In this project, our stakeholders are looking to understand the key differences between the casual and member users of the bike sharing system, they believe that we must look for a way to make the casual users become members as this brings more rentability in the long term.
## The project
Our manager Lili Moreno has requested us to look for the answer to the following questions by analyzing the data. In this case we will look for the data of the year 2022 which is in CSV files each month. 
Three questions will guide the future marketing program: 
1. How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?
 2. Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships? 
3. How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?

These are the deliverables our stakeholders our looking for:
1. A clear statement of the business task
2. A description of all data sources used
3. Documentation of any cleaning or manipulation of data
4. A summary of your analysis
5. Supporting visualizations and key findings
6. Your top three recommendations based on your analysis
   
Business Task:
Learn the key differences between the members and the casual users of the bike system to understand their behavior and seek the way to encourage casual users to become members.
Data sources:

The trips data is data coming from the same company therefore it’s a reliable source of data.

## Conclusions:
From the analysis and the graphs presented we can conclude that member users utilize the bikes in a more consistent way than the casual users, even though the casual users have longer trips on average they have less trips by week and month compared. The members most likely use the bikes to work while the casual for pleasure and to see the city. 

Casual members could be more inclined to acquire an annual membership if this one could be  charged by month and perhaps used for limited trips and with promotions for the weekend so they can merge more with the brand and see us as the best option.

Cyclistic could use social media, specially “Tik Tok” to promote trips specially for casual members and users that bike for pleasure, we could also look for a map in the app for places to visit and be guided by the Cyclistic app on their phone along with promotions that if you visit a restaurant with the bike you get a little discount and if you are a member the discount is greater. 
## Recommendations 
1)Focus on the casuals and the way they use the app, if they use for touristic or pleasure purposes the best way to get them to sign up for the membership would be by offering promotions to do so, for example for going to certain place or visit a restaurant.

2)Use social media to market the benefits of biking and our app and why a membership is worth it.

3) Create a  more customized membership for the casual since they are using differently and traveling less, we should create a membership that adjusts to them.
